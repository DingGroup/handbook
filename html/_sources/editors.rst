Text Editors
================

VSCode 
-----------------
It is highly recommended to use the text editor `VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_.
You can log onto the the computing cluster and edit files in VSCode.
Here is a guide on how to do that: `VSCode on the Tufts cluster <https://tufts.app.box.com/v/HPC-New-User/folder/206653625080>`_.
It has many very useful features and extensions that can help you write code more efficiently.
Here are some useful extensions for VSCode: 

- For logging on to the cluster
    - Remote - SSH
    - Remote - SSH: Editing Configuration Files
    - Remote - Tunnel

- For programming in Python
    - Python
    - Pylance
    - Ruff

- For using Jupyter Notebooks
    - Jupyter
    - Jupyter Keymap
    - Jupyter Notebook Render

- For using GitHub Copilot
    - GitHub Copilot

VSCode also suggests extensions as you open different file types.


Editors via the Command Line
----------------------------
Commonly used text editors that can be accessed via the command line include: ``vim`` and ``emacs``.
They have a steeper learning curve than ``VSCode`` and offer fewer features, but are still very powerful. They were widely used before ``VSCode`` became popular.
