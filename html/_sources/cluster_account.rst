Cluster Account
==============================================================

1. Create a new cluster account.
--------------------------------
If you don't have an account on the computing cluster, follow the instructions below to create one.

- Open `Tufts high performance computing (HPC) website <https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing>`_.
- Click "**Cluster Account Request**‚Äù.
- Log in using your Tufts credentials.
- Fill in all the information that is needed. Use **Xinqiang Ding** for the research group/advisor name.
- Submit the request.

Within a few days, the Tufts HPC team will create an account for you and send you a confirmation email once it is ready.

2. Request access to the storage space.
----------------------------------------------------------
Let Xinqiang Ding know after your cluster account is ready. He will request access to the storage space of the **Ding Lab** for you.

3. Log in to the cluster.
-------------------------
The `Tufts HPC welcome page <https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing/hpc-welcome-page>`_ provides a `New User Guide` introducing how to log in to the cluster and how to use the cluster.
The website also provides other useful information about the cluster. Please read them carefully and remember to come back to it when you have questions.


4. Home directory v.s. storage directory
----------------------------------------
When your cluster account is created, you should be able to access your home directory ``/cluster/home/your_utln``. Note that your home directory has a very limited storage space (10GB), so you should not store large files in it. 

Instead you should use the storage directory ``/cluster/tufts/dinglab/your_utln`` for all your projects. You should be able to access your storage directory after Xinqiang Ding requests access to the storage space for you. The storage directory has a much larger storage space. You can create any subdirectories in the storage directory as you like to organize your files.

NOTE: Accessing your research project storage space for the first time, make sure you type out the full path to the directory.
