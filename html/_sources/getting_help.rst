Getting Help
============

Your research routine involves using different computational tools and writing code. You will inevitably have questions or run into problems. You should not be shy about asking for help and you could get help in a number of ways.

1. **Ask ChatGPT**. You should create an account on `ChatGPT <chat.openai.com>`_. ChatGPT could answer many of your questions about computing and programming. If you want to know how to do A, just type the question ``How to do A?``. At the time of writing, ChatGPT is very good at answering questions about simple programming questions, such as how to do something in a specific programming language or a specific software package, how to use a certain command, and how to write a simple script to do something. **However**, you should not take its answers for granted and you should always check/test its answers. 

2. **Google it**. If the answer from ChatGPT is not correct/satisfactory, you should google it. Other people might have asked the same question before and you could find the answer on the Internet. 

3. **Ask other lab members**. If you still cannot find the answer, you should ask your colleagues. They might have encountered the same problem before and they might be able to help you.
