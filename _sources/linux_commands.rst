Linux commands
==============

The computing cluster is running on with a Linux operation system, so you need to know some basic Linux commands to navigate the file system, make and edit files, and run programs. 
There are many Linux commands, but you only need to know a few to get started. The website `Linux Command <http://linuxcommand.org/>`_ has a good introduction to Linux commands. 
Here are some basic Linux commands that you will use frequently: ``ls``, ``cd``, ``pwd``, ``mkdir``, ``cp``, ``mv``, ``rm``, ``cat``, ``less``, ``head``, ``tail``, ``grep``, ``wc``, ``chmod``, ``ssh``, ``scp``, ``top``, ``time``, ``source``, ``which``, ``find``, ``tar``.

If you forget how a command works, you can always use the ``man`` command to get the manual page for the command. For example, if you want to know how the ``ls`` command works, you can type ``man ls`` in the terminal to get the manual page for the ``ls`` command.

If you want to do something but don't know which linux command to use, you could ask ChatGPT or google it. For example, if you want to know how to copy a file, you could ask ChatGPU or google "how to copy a file in Linux".
